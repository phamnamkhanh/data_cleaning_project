The result tidy dataset contains following variables:
1) subject: ID of the subject in the experiment
2) activity: types of activity
3) The third group of variables are the mean estimation of signal received from accelerometer and gyroscope
    The naming convention of these variables are given as follows: "name_of_signal"+".mean..."+"dimension" or "name_of_signal"+".mean.."
    Examples: "tBodyAcc.mean...X"; "tBodyAccJerkMag.mean.."; etc.
    
4) The forth group of variables are the standard deviation estimation of signal received from accelerometer and gyroscope
    The naming convention of these variables are given as follows: "name_of_signal"+".std..."+"dimension" or "name_of_signal"+".std.."
    Examples: "tGravityAcc.std...X" ; "tBodyGyroJerkMag.std.."; etc.

5) The signals received from accelerometer and gyroscope are described as follows:
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
